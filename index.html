                <h2>The Cat Facts</h2>
            
                <ul type="circle">
                    <li>Cats have been domesticated for around 4,000 years. While they were once valued for their hunting abilities, they are now valued for their companionship and loving behaviour.</li>
                    <li>While not well known, the collective nouns used for cats and kittens are a clowder of cats and a kindle of kittens.</li>
                    <li>Our domestic cats are known as little cats. They differ from large cats such as lions and tigers because they are naturally active at night and can purr.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>Cats have 30 teeth (dogs have 42) and most of us know how sharp they are!</li>
                    <li>Cats have a reflective layer in their eyes, known as the tapetum lucidum, which magnifies incoming light allowing them to see up to 6 times better than humans can in low light. Cats (as well as dogs) also have a ‘third eyelid’ called the nictitating membrane which is found on the inside corner of the eye which is an extra protective function of the eye.</li>
                    <li>Cats have 32 muscles in their ears (humans have only 12). This gives the ear mobility, enabling it to precisely locate prey such as mice or the opening of their cat food! Cats can also hear frequencies that are both below and above those that can be heard by humans. The ear also has the job of helping to maintain balance and the ability to right themselves when falling – which is where the phrase “Cats always land on their feet” came from.</li>
                    <li>More cats are left-pawed than right.</li>
                </ol>
